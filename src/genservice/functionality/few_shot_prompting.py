1. Experience:
### Introduction:
- Software development engineer with more than three years of experience; specialize in software development and distributed systems; worked on projects with different approaches and sizes of teams.

### Project Description:
- The first project involved medical reports at Microsoft, utilizing the win form.NET framework;
the second project was a Warehouse application using WPF and MVVM patterns, along with Entity Framework and MSSQL;
another project was for an American government company, involving registration, marriages, debts, and businesses.

2. Product Area Impact:
### Main Responsibilities:
- Translating business requirements into technical tasks;
- Designing, planning, and prioritizing;
- Code implementation;
- Quality assurance;
- Presenting the final product for evaluation.

### Candidate's Position and Main Stack of Technologies:
- Works as a Software Development Engineer now. Stack of technologies includes **[Names of Technologies]**.
---
3. Independency:
### Previous Experience/Main Responsibilities (Conclusion):
- While describing their previous experience, the candidate mentioned at least two projects where they had to take full release cycle responsibilities: from discussing business requirements with stakeholders, to translating them into technical tasks, planning, implementing, and presenting the final product for evaluation.
---
4. Proactivity:
### Previous Experience/Main Responsibilities (Conclusion):
- The candidate explained that their professional experience is tightly connected with projects of flexible and dynamic requirements. As a result, their designing workflow evolved to predicting (or at least presupposing) extensibility of their codebase, keeping the number of non-standard solutions to the bare minimum to avoid unnecessary customization.
---
5. Mentoring:
### Previous Mentoring Experience:
- The candidate has no significant mentoring experience.

### Team Size:
- Experience working with teams of different sizes, from 6 to 25 people; now works in a cross-functional
team of 10 people, 5 backend and 5 frontend engineers.

### Git Experience, Git Flow Organization, CI/CD:
- Current Git flow depends on project size; main branch is protected, with feature branches for development; developers create branches, work on features, and submit pull requests for merging.
- Worked extensively with Git; primarily use Visual Studio for .NET development and Git Bash for specific commands; prefer to merge to maintain branch hierarchy; understand Azure DevOps and have used it to create pipelines; prefer classic UI editor for ease of use.
- CI involves building artifacts like Docker images and running tests; CD is divided into delivery and deployment, with tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions used for CI.

### Experience with Agile/Scrum/Kanban:
- Used Scrum for about ten months with daily standups and two-week sprints; switched to a Kanban, due to a lot of 
cross-functional tasks between different teams; easier to track using Kanban Board.

### Python:
- The candidate has a good practical experience both in implementing a modern asynchronous services (Flask, asyncio, 
noSQL DBs such as Elasticsearch and MongoDB, and Ansible) and in maintaining and improving some really old legacy 
codebase (Python 2 with PostgreSQL). The candidate lacks some experience in async theory.

### Linux:
- Linux:
The candidate uses Linux as their main development platform, and he uses Linux inside their service containers as well. 
THey proved his familiarity with Linux CLI by naming a list of his usual Bash commands: docker, git, ssh, grep, and 
also a bunch of commands from the coreutils package.
